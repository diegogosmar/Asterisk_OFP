# Asterisk OFP - Multi-Agent AI Voice System

Production-ready conversational AI platform built on Asterisk PBX with OFP (Open Voice Network) protocol compliance.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **multi-agent AI voice system** that orchestrates specialized AI agents in a conference call environment, featuring:

- üé§ Real-time speech recognition (Deepgram ASR)
- ü§ñ Dynamic AI responses (OpenAI GPT-4 + Deepgram TTS)
- üéµ Zero-latency async hold music
- üìã OFP v1.0.0 protocol implementation
- üîÑ Smart agent floor control management

## Architecture

![System Architecture](assets/architecture-diagram.png)

The system uses a **mixed agent architecture** combining:
- **Agent0**: Async hold music (fills processing time)
- **Agent1**: Dynamic LLM agent (GPT-4 powered responses)
- **Agent2-3**: Static stub agents (prerecorded audio)

See [Architecture Documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.

## Key Features

### Zero-Latency User Experience
Agent0 plays "please wait" message asynchronously while Agent1 generates response, eliminating perceived waiting time.

### Smart Playback Management
ARI playback status polling ensures precise audio completion detection without fixed delays.

### OFP Protocol Compliance
Full implementation of Open Voice Network's Open Floor Protocol v0.9.2:
- `grantFloor` - Convener grants speaking permission
- `requestFloor` - Agent requests to speak
- `yieldFloor` - Agent releases floor
